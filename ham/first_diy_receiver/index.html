    HAM - First diy receiver

        Here's the story of how I made my first radio receiver, in the summer of 2022, being 17 years old.
	I essentially built the awesome regenerative receiver designed by DX Explorer: <a href="https://dxexplorer.com/sputnik-regenerative-receiver-v1-0/">Sputnik Regenerative Receiver v1.0</a>. I cut as many components from it as possible to make it easy and quick to build. Doing this sort of bakfired on me, you'll see why later.
